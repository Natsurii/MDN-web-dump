# HTML
aka, **Hypertext Markup Language**, tells the browser how it will structure a site.

```html
<p> HTML consists a series of elements. </p>
```

### Anatomy of HTML

```html
<!-- HTML elements consists of 3 main parts -->
    <p> This is the content </p>
<!-- |             |          |
     |             |          |
     Opening tag   |          |
                The content   |
                            Closing tag 
-->
```
- **Opening tag** - the name of element wrapped in angle brackets.
- **Content** - The content of the element
- **Closing tag** - Same with the opening tag, but it includes a foward slash before the element name and marks the end of the element.

### Nesting of Elements 
```html
<!-- HTML Elements can be placed inside of an element, and this is called element nesting. -->
<p><strong>As you can see, the strong element is inside of the element p</strong><p>
<!-- The paragraph above will look like in a bold text because of the strong element -->

<!-- This a bad way of nesting of elements. -->
<p><i>The closing tag of italic element should be inside of the p element</p></i>
<!-- The browser does the guessing of your misformatted element, and it may look like the one you will expect to see.-->
```

### Empty Elements 
```html
<!- Not all tags has content, like img tag, it only has opening and closing tag -->

```

### Attributes
```html
<!-- Elements can have an attributes too. -->
<p class="explanation-tile"> This paragraph element has an attribute </p>
```
An attribute should have:
- A space between an element name
- attribute name, followed by an equal sign
- attribute value, wrapped in quote marks

### Active Learning, anchor element.
`<a>` stands for **Anchor**. Anchor makes an text into an hyperlink. The anchors can take attributes, the following are examples:
- `href` - specifies the web address of link
- `title` - Shows the description of the hyperlink when hovered.
- `target` - specifies browsing context used to display link. 

```html
<p>This is a demonstration of an anchor, you can read about the article <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<!-- the `target="_blank"` context makes the link open in new tab. -->
```
